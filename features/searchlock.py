"""
USE:
objects should be:
    obj.locks.add("search:false()")

Vanilla Evennia does not allow true hidden objects by default.

The 'view' lock will prevent the object being displayed in a room's description
and stop the look command with "Could not view 'object(#9)'", where as
attempting to look at a non-existant object returns 'Could not find '<object>''.

Likewise, the 'get' lock will disallow getting with "Could not get 'object(#9)'" 
instead of "Could not find '<object>'".

Both of which give away the existance of a hidden object.

This is a Mixin typeclass to implement the Search() method to respect a lock
'search'. Where search = false, then the search command will ignore it, achieveing
what the 'view' and 'get' locks do not.

Because the get command uses search, search=false objects will not be gettable
BUT because rooms use self.contents rather than search, they will still display
search = false objects unless the 'lock' is also false.

I can see times when a visible object should not be subject to search and so 
they should be separate locks. However, something that is not searchable will
ordinarily not be visible.

        Returns an Object matching a search string/condition

        Perform a standard object search in the database, handling
        multiple results and lack thereof gracefully. By default, only
        objects in the current `location` of `self` or its inventory are searched for.

        Args:
            searchdata (str or obj): Primary search criterion. Will be matched
                against `object.key` (with `object.aliases` second) unless
                the keyword attribute_name specifies otherwise.

                Special strings:

                - `#<num>`: search by unique dbref. This is always
                   a global search.
                - `me,self`: self-reference to this object
                - `<num>-<string>` - can be used to differentiate
                   between multiple same-named matches. The exact form of this input
                   is given by `settings.SEARCH_MULTIMATCH_REGEX`.

            global_search (bool): Search all objects globally. This overrules 'location' data.
            use_nicks (bool): Use nickname-replace (nicktype "object") on `searchdata`.
            typeclass (str or Typeclass, or list of either): Limit search only
                to `Objects` with this typeclass. May be a list of typeclasses
                for a broader search.
            location (Object or list): Specify a location or multiple locations
                to search. Note that this is used to query the *contents* of a
                location and will not match for the location itself -
                if you want that, don't set this or use `candidates` to specify
                exactly which objects should be searched.
            attribute_name (str): Define which property to search. If set, no
                key+alias search will be performed. This can be used
                to search database fields (db_ will be automatically
                prepended), and if that fails, it will try to return
                objects having Attributes with this name and value
                equal to searchdata. A special use is to search for
                "key" here if you want to do a key-search without
                including aliases.
            quiet (bool): don't display default error messages - this tells the
                search method that the user wants to handle all errors
                themselves. It also changes the return value type, see
                below.
            exact (bool): if unset (default) - prefers to match to beginning of
                string rather than not matching at all. If set, requires
                exact matching of entire string.
            candidates (list of objects): this is an optional custom list of objects
                to search (filter) between. It is ignored if `global_search`
                is given. If not set, this list will automatically be defined
                to include the location, the contents of location and the
                caller's contents (inventory).
            use_locks (bool): If True (default) - removes search results which
                fail the "search" lock.
            nofound_string (str):  optional custom string for not-found error message.
            multimatch_string (str): optional custom string for multimatch error header.
            use_dbref (bool or None, optional): If `True`, allow to enter e.g. a query "#123"
                to find an object (globally) by its database-id 123. If `False`, the string "#123"
                will be treated like a normal string. If `None` (default), the ability to query by
                #dbref is turned on if `self` has the permission 'Builder' and is turned off
                otherwise.

        Returns:
            Object, None or list: Will return an `Object` or `None` if `quiet=False`. Will return a
            list with 0, 1 or more matches if `quiet=True`. If `stacked` is a positive integer, this
            list may contain all stacked identical matches.

        Notes:
            To find Accounts, use eg. `evennia.account_search`. If
            `quiet=False`, error messages will be handled by
            `settings.SEARCH_AT_RESULT` and echoed automatically (on
            error, return will be `None`). If `quiet=True`, the error
            messaging is assumed to be handled by the caller.
