Connection screen

This is the text shown to the user when they first connect to the game (before
they log in).

The commands available to the user when the connection screen is shown
are defined in evennia.default_cmds.UnloggedinCmdSet. The parsing and display
of the screen is done by the unlogged-in "look" command.
